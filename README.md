# Neural Amp Modeler: Colab Notebooks
Example / template repo of separating Colab Notebooks from the main code.

## Google Colab notebooks

If you don't have a good computer for training ML models, you use Google Colab to train
in the cloud using the pre-made notebooks under `train`.

**Pros:**

- No local installation required!
- Decent GPUs are available if you don't have one on your computer.

**Cons:**

- Uploading your data can take a long time.
- Daily usage limit.
- The session can time out after inactivity, potentially resulting in the loss of files (more on this later)


For the very easiest experience, open 
[`easy_colab.ipynb` on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/d-Vincent-b/NeuralAmpModeler-ColabNotebooks/blob/main/train/easy_colab.ipynb)
and follow the steps!

### Please familiarize yourself with the above notebook before trying anything else####
